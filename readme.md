## Features

- Customizable punishments for combat logging, including:
  - Killing the player upon log out.
  - Broadcasting a custom death message.
  - Temporary bans for repeated offenses.
- Highly configurable
  
## Installation
1. Download the plugin JAR file and place it in your server's `plugins` folder.
2. Restart your server to load the plugin.

## Configuration
The plugin is highly configurable. Open `config.yml` to customize the behavior, such as enabling or disabling combat log punishment, setting custom messages, and defining escalation punishments for repeated offenses.
